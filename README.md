### “ In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists. ” - Eric Hoffer

My life thumbnail sketch :

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Innovative Labs, and trying to provide best content on web development for FREE.
- 📚 What do I beleive? Jack of all, Master of some.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage my time, and be productive.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any idea that impresses me.
- 💬 Ask me about Web Development, Machine Learning, Design, Marketing, Sales, Community Building.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Irish Coffee ☕

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey,
and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the
game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions
has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt
of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background,
spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another
vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer.
Currently, I have more than 100k followers on Instagram, a top blogger
tag on Quora, and a highly engaging audience on LinkedIn.

Spending almost four years into machine learning and artificial
intelligence, teaching and assisting more than 500 students, winning
three hackathons, and giving a lot of talks, I stepped into research
where I published 3 research papers. I am a researcher turned
Entrepreneur as after continuing my research for 18 months, I thought of a product around it and presented it to the audience. My research
revolves around AI psychology and multimodal analysis of data.

Social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of
digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence.
